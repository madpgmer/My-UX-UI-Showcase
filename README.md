# My UX-UI-Showcase

##Design Idea for Mockup
###Social media sites are a great marketing tool but lack the features to show photographer's best work. There is a major problem of image theft on most major social media platforms. Watermarks can be easily manipulated. Many photographers have their own websites, or free apps in which customers can view their works. However, there is a key professional networking feature missing. Photographers need an option to connect with other photographers to collaborate, share their work, receive tips and tricks, and even have a trading option on camera related equipment. 

###This system design is mainly targeted towards photographers, be it professionals or amateurs. 

###The way users check their Facebook or Instagram feed regularly for updates from those they follow and comments on their own posts, users would interact with and experience the works of others. In that context, this app would be one of many social media apps. The place where this app becomes unique is where it is also a resource for photographers to use in the field. By accessing the collected experience of every other user, they can get answers to the questions they have at a momentâ€™s notice.
